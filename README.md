# 💻 DevOps Lab Portfolio by Michael Olowoniran.

Welcome to my hands-on DevOps learning portfolio. This repository contains real projects, automation scripts, command-line practice, and issue resolutions that reflect my continuous journey toward becoming a skilled Cloud & DevOps Engineer.

## 🚀 What This Portfolio Covers (So Far)

✅ Vagrant & VirtualBox — provisioning Ubuntu VMs  
✅ Linux command-line mastery — navigation, scripting, permissions  
✅ Shell scripting — user management, backups, and automation  
✅ Git & GitHub — daily workflows, version tracking, branching  
✅ Troubleshooting logs — real errors, real solutions  

Each section represents **real hands-on work** I’ve done, not just tutorials — backed by working files, outputs, and notes.

## 📚 Current Learning Roadmap

Here’s what I’m currently building into my DevOps stack — each item will be added to this repo as I gain hands-on experience:

- 🐍 **Python scripting** — for automation, file handling, and API tasks  
- 🐳 **Docker** — containerization, image building, Dockerfiles  
- ⚙️ **Ansible** — configuration management and idempotent deployments  
- 🛠 **Terraform** — infrastructure as code (IaC) for cloud provisioning  
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud** — EC2, S3, IAM, and deployment workflows  
- 🔧 **Jenkins** — building CI/CD pipelines  
- 📦 **CI/CD** — integrating tools, GitOps, automation testing  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** — orchestration of containerized applications  
- 📜 **Advanced automation scripts** — cron jobs, monitoring tools, system health checks  

This isn’t just a list — it’s my **accountability path**.

## 🧠 Why I’m Sharing This

Because DevOps isn’t about faking expertise — it’s about building it from the ground up:
- Fixing real problems
- Learning how systems behave
- Automating what you understand
- Versioning everything

If you're a recruiter, engineer, or mentor — this portfolio is an open window into my commitment, progress, and capabilities.


## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |

| `vagrant-ubuntu-setup/` | Vagrantfiles and notes for setting up Ubuntu VMs |
| `linux-commands/` | Real Linux command-line practice and examples |
| `shell-scripts/` | User automation, backup scripts, etc. |
| `git-commands/` | Git workflows, version control practice |
| `logs-troubleshooting/` | Real error screenshots and how I fixed them |

More folders (e.g., `docker/`, `terraform/`, `ansible/` python/  etc) coming soon.

## 🔗 Let’s Connect

If you're in DevOps, Cloud, or SRE — or hiring for those roles — I’d love to collaborate, learn, or build.

# VProfile Deployment Project  ~@

This project demonstrates the deployment of a Java-based web application (`vprofile`) using the following:

- ✅ **Tomcat** (Application Server)
- ✅ **MariaDB/MySQL** (Database Server)
- ✅ **RabbitMQ** (Messaging Queue)
- ✅ **Nginx** (Reverse Proxy)
- ✅ **Maven** (Build Tool)

##  M-' Setup Done So Far

- Provisioned all virtual machines
- Set up `db01` VM with MariaDB and initialized DB + users
- Set up `app01` VM with Apache Tomcat and Maven
- Deployed WAR file to Tomcat
- Configured `web01` VM with Nginx reverse proxy
- RabbitMQ is being configured (`rmq01` VM)
