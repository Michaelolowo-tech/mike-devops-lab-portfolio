# 💻 DevOps Lab Portfolio by [Michael Olowoniran]

Welcome to my hands-on DevOps learning portfolio. This repository contains real-world projects, scripts, notes, and troubleshooting logs from my journey toward becoming a well-rounded Cloud and DevOps Engineer.


## Why This Portfolio?

DevOps isn’t just about writing YAML or pushing pipelines — it’s about understanding the system, solving real errors, and building confidently from the command line up.

This repo captures what I’ve actually done — not just what I’ve watched.


## 📁 Projects & Practice Areas

### 🔧 [Vagrant Ubuntu VM Setup](./vagrant-ubuntu-setup/)
- Provisioned Ubuntu 22.04 VM using Vagrant and VirtualBox
- Configured port forwarding, synced folders, and resource limits
- Solved NAT and SSH issues, refined `Vagrantfile`

### 🧮 [Linux Command Practice](./linux-commands/)
- Mastered essential Linux navigation, file handling, and permission commands
- Practiced user/group management and log inspection with `grep`, `tail`, etc.
- Captured real-world command use and notes

### 📜 [Shell Scripts](./shell-scripts/)
- Wrote automation scripts for file backups, system checks, and user management
- Used Bash best practices and inline documentation
- Demonstrated command chaining, pipes, conditionals

### 🔁 [Git & Version Control](./git-commands/)
- Used Git to track changes, commit responsibly, and recover fast
- Practiced real DevOps workflows: init, branch, clone, revert
- Integrated version control into Vagrant and scripting projects

### 🛠 [Logs & Troubleshooting](./logs-troubleshooting/)
- Real errors I encountered while working on VMs and Linux
- Includes screenshots of SSH failures, Vagrant misconfigurations, syntax bugs
- Notes on how I debugged and solved them

## 🚀 What I’m Working Toward

I’m building not just technical skills, but reliability, root cause thinking, and automation habits — the backbone of modern DevOps.

This repo reflects the hours spent fixing broken VMs, debugging shell scripts, and documenting every win and mistake.
