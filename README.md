# 💻 DevOps Lab Portfolio by Michael Olowoniran.

Welcome to my hands-on DevOps learning portfolio. This repository contains real projects, automation scripts, command-line practice, and issue resolutions that reflect my continuous journey toward becoming a skilled Cloud & DevOps Engineer.

## 🚀 What This Portfolio Covers (So Far)

✅ Vagrant & VirtualBox — provisioning Ubuntu VMs  
✅ Linux command-line mastery — navigation, scripting, permissions  
✅ Shell scripting — user management, backups, and automation  
✅ Git & GitHub — daily workflows, version tracking, branching  
✅ Troubleshooting logs — real errors, real solutions  

Each section represents **real hands-on work** I’ve done, not just tutorials — backed by working files, outputs, and notes.

## 📚 Current Learning Roadmap

Here’s what I’m currently building into my DevOps stack — each item will be added to this repo as I gain hands-on experience:

- 🐍 **Python scripting** — for automation, file handling, and API tasks  
- 🐳 **Docker** — containerization, image building, Dockerfiles  
- ⚙️ **Ansible** — configuration management and idempotent deployments  
- 🛠 **Terraform** — infrastructure as code (IaC) for cloud provisioning  
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud** — EC2, S3, IAM, and deployment workflows  
- 🔧 **Jenkins** — building CI/CD pipelines  
- 📦 **CI/CD** — integrating tools, GitOps, automation testing  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** — orchestration of containerized applications  
- 📜 **Advanced automation scripts** — cron jobs, monitoring tools, system health checks  

This isn’t just a list — it’s my **accountability path**.

## 🧠 Why I’m Sharing This

Because DevOps isn’t about faking expertise — it’s about building it from the ground up:
- Fixing real problems
- Learning how systems behave
- Automating what you understand
- Versioning everything

If you're a recruiter, engineer, or mentor — this portfolio is an open window into my commitment, progress, and capabilities.
